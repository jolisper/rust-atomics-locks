# Rust Atomics and Locks Examples

## Introduction

This repository is a personal selection and experimentation based on the examples provided in the book "Rust Atomics and Locks". The purpose of this project is to serve as a personal reference and to explore the concepts illustrated in the book through hands-on examples.

## Book Overview

"Rust Atomics and Locks" is a comprehensive guide that delves into the intricacies of concurrent programming in Rust. It covers the use of atomic operations, various locking mechanisms, and other concurrency primitives provided by Rust.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories that correspond to the chapters of the book. Each directory contains Rust source files with examples that I've selected and possibly modified for experimentation and better understanding.

## Usage

To run any of the examples, you can navigate to the directory of the example you're interested in and use the common Cargo subcommands such as `cargo build`, `cargo test`, or `cargo run`.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to the authors of "Rust Atomics and Locks" for their insightful and practical approach to explaining concurrent programming in Rust.
